Screeny is an easy-to-use tool that records your screen activity and tracks keyboard/mouse actions. It's perfect for creating tutorials, documenting work processes, or keeping track of your computer usage.

## What Does Screeny Do?

- Records your screen (all monitors simultaneously)
- Logs your keyboard typing and mouse movements
